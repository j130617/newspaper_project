This is indeed the case: Use of the word “innovative” has increased more quickly than “creative” over the sample period. To the extent that our ad hoc classification included only one of these two words, we would be mis-characterizing trends in the ONET skill of “Thinking Creatively.” The advantage of the continuous bag of words model is that it will identify that “creative” and “innovative” mean the same thing because they appear in similar contexts within job ads. Hence, even if employers start using “innovative” as opposed to “creative” part way through our sample, we will be able to consistently measure trends in “Thinking Creatively” throughout the entire period.*"
